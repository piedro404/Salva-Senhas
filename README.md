# Message for you
Hello, I hope you have a good learning experience, that you can clear your doubts or implement your projects. Feel free to make suggestions to improve the script.

I'm Pedro Henrique Martins Borges, I live in São Raimundo das Mangabeiras/Maranhão, in Brazil, university and 17 years old. I've been studying programming since I was 14 and I'm increasingly fascinated by the universe that is programming, and I know I'm very inexperienced and I'll keep trying harder and harder to be able to enter the job market and help my family.

Whether for Hobby or with a desire to professionalize, I wish you great studies and a great journey and remember: “You say you have a dream… That dream… You have to make it come true. Make your wonderful dream come true and it will become your truth. If anyone can do this, it's you!” by: N/Pokemon.
